                        <p>Have you ever heard the expression, “Do not count your chickens before they hatch?” Maybe an
                            older, wiser individual would tell you this to keep you from getting ahead of yourself. Like
                            buying a new car before you actually got that new job. Well, when setting and obtaining your
                            goals, you need to “Count your chicken before they hatch” in your mind. What I mean by this
                            is
                            you have to start seeing yourself completing or obtaining your goal. What you profess, you
                            possess!

                            The first thing you need to do is sit down and set your goals. Diana Scharf Hunt said “Goals
                            are
                            dreams with deadlines.” A lot of times, people are thrown off by the idea of taking the time
                            to
                            set their goals. But when you take a trip, do you not come up with a plan and ultimate
                            destination. Well, setting goals is the same process. I suggest that you first do a Must
                            Have,
                            Why, How analysis. First, write down a list of must haves; bigger home, luxury trips, new
                            cars,
                            work from home, etc. Then decide why these must haves are important to you and prioritize
                            them.
                            Lastly, write down how you are going to get the must haves.

                            Also, ask yourself these questions:

                            Why do I not have what I want now?

                            What are the tools and resources do I need?

                            What past experiences are in the way?

                            Who can I talk to that has already succeeded?

                            How am I paying for this?

                            What are the tradeoffs?

                            What am I going to give up?

                            From this analysis, start writing down you goals. Remember, without a start, there cannot be
                            an
                            ending. Denis Watley stated “The reason most people never reach their goals is that they do
                            not
                            define them, or ever seriously consider them as believable or achievable. Winners can tell
                            you
                            where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who will be sharing the
                            adventure
                            with them.” Once finished writing your goals, next you need to start visualizing your
                            dreams.
                            Henry David Thoreau once said “If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams,
                            and
                            endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in
                            common hours.” You need image yourself accomplishing your goals and obtaining your
                            treasures.
                            Will yourself into succeeding. Never think that you cannot reach your desired results. Talk
                            about the desires as if you have already obtained it. A good practice is to read your goals
                            daily. If you are having a bad day, read them over and over.

                            Thirdly, you need to get the tools and resources to needed to accomplish your goals. Maybe
                            you
                            have decided to start a home-based business as a mechanism to consummate the acquiring of
                            your
                            dreams. Start gathering documentation on how to run your home-based business. Join service
                            group
                            that might help you. Take the step to start reaching your goals. Kathy Seligman said “You
                            cannot
                            hit a home run unless you step up to the plate. You cannot catch a fish unless you put your
                            line
                            in the water. You cannot reach your goals if you do not try.” Get started today!!

                            The fourth point is to surround yourself with like-minded people. In the Bible, Jesus told
                            one
                            of his disciples, “Get behind me Satan.” What he was saying was if you are not with me, you
                            are
                            against me. The same applies to you. Detach yourself from people who are negative towards
                            you
                            goals. If you are going to be rich, why not surround yourself with people who are already
                            rich.
                            David Joseph Schwartz once said “Think little goals and expect little achievements. Think
                            big
                            goals and win big success.”

                            Lastly, and most importantly, do not be afraid of success. This phobia is the main reason
                            most
                            people fail. They make no preparation for succeeding. When they succeed, they do not know
                            how to
                            act. People start questioning their success. They start telling themselves that they do not
                            deserve to be successful. And eventually, obtain what they profess. When you are setting
                            your
                            goals, make a plan for being successful. Tell yourself that you deserve to be successful and
                            that you should procure your desires. Catherine Pulsifer best sums this up, “The unfortunate
                            aspect about living life without your own goals is that you may very well reach a point in
                            your
                            life where you will wonder, what would have happened if I had only done…” In closing, the
                            first
                            thing you need to do is start planning and setting your goals. Then you need start
                            visualizing
                            yourself completing your dreams. Also, you will need to get some tools and resources that
                            will
                            help you achieve you goals. And surround yourself with people who are positive and have the
                            same
                            goals as you do. And most importantly, prepare yourself for success. When the time comes, do
                            not
                            be afraid to be successful. Think about this, in the Bible Jesus said, “As a man thinketh in
                            his
                            heart, so is he.” You need to start seeing yourself as attaining your goals. Act and talk as
                            if
                            you already have obtained them. Now get started!.</p>
